    date: '15 July 2025',
    summary: 'Learn about the key provisions of the Rent Control Act and how you can protect your rights as a tenant when dealing with landlords and security deposits.',
    content: `Renting a home in India comes with both rights and responsibilities. The Rent Control Act, enacted to protect tenants from exploitation, outlines specific provisions regarding rent increases, eviction, and security deposits. In this article we explore what constitutes a legal eviction, how to handle a landlord who refuses to return your security deposit, and the steps to take if you receive an illegal rent hike notice.\n\nThe act requires landlords to provide proper notice before asking tenants to vacate and prohibits arbitrary rent hikes. Tenants are entitled to seek legal recourse if their landlord violates these provisions. Always ensure that you have a written rent agreement and keep records of rent payments. If a dispute arises, approach the local rent controller or consider sending a legal notice through a lawyer or legal aid clinic.`,
